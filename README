Infor Coding Test

File Locations:
    Main Source Files: infor/
    JUnit Files: test/infor/

Use Directions:
To run the program please use the included make file
make file commands:
    make: will compile the program
    make run: will execute the code
    make clean: will delete all class files

Notes:
    I used intellij to create and run the Junit test cases using JUint 4.12
    I used maven to import com.googlecode.json-simple to use JSON

Things I completed:
    Print employee tree
    Print total salary
    Sort employees

Things I missed:
    I didn't get the print formatting quite right, I could have just created it manually 
    but I wasn't able to discern the answer programatically

    I didn't finish the JSON parsing, The documentation for the library didn't match the 
    functionality so I wasn't able to implement the parsing
